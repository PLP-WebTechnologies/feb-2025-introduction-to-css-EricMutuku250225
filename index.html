        <p class="highlight">New tires are designed with advanced technology to enhance performance, safety, and efficiency. They typically feature improved tread patterns for better grip on various surfaces, innovative rubber compounds for durability, and optimized designs to reduce rolling resistance, which can improve fuel economy. Many new tires also incorporate eco-friendly materials, making them more sustainable. Whether tailored for off-road adventures, high-speed driving, or all-weather conditions, modern tires continue to push the boundaries of engineering to meet diverse needs. ðŸš—âœ¨</p>

        <div id="special-div">Tire sealants help extend the life of tires by sealing small punctures and preventing air leaks, which keeps tire pressure steady and reduces wear. They are a temporary fix and may not work for larger punctures or sidewall damage, so itâ€™s best to use them as a short-term solution while arranging for professional repairs.</div>
